<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Resistant Flexible Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire-resistant flexible sealant market comprises two main types: elastomeric and intumescent. Elastomeric sealants are rubber-like substances that maintain flexibility and seal against fire, smoke, and water while adhering to various surfaces. Intumescent sealants, on the other hand, expand when exposed to high temperatures, forming a charred layer that insulates and protects against flames. Both types are vital for ensuring enhanced fire safety in construction and infrastructure, providing different mechanisms to combat fire hazards effectively.</p></p>
