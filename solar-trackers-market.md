<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Trackers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis</li><li>Dual Axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar trackers market is primarily divided into two types: single-axis and dual-axis trackers. Single-axis trackers rotate on one axis, typically following the sun’s east-to-west movement, optimizing energy capture throughout the day. Dual-axis trackers adjust both horizontally and vertically, allowing for maximum sunlight exposure by tilting with the sun's elevation change. While dual-axis systems can yield higher energy production, single-axis trackers are generally more cost-effective and easier to maintain, making each type suited for different project needs and budget constraints.</p></p>
